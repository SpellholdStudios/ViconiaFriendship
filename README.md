## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

One of the things many find sorely lacking in the Bioware NPCs are the more complex relationships presented by modern NPC mods--especially in regards to "friendships," the relationships NPCs have with the PC when not romancing them.

This mod adds a series of dialogues for a female PC or a male PC who has turned Viconia down, and attempts to give someone who isn't interested in a romantic relationship something to bite into. But bear in mind that Viconia is not an easy person to talk to, let alone befriend. She has a mind of her own, and although she is willing to travel with you, she may not wish to become your confidante.

I hope you enjoy the mod as much as I have writing it! - K'aeloree

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

The Viconia Friendship mod should be compatible with all WeiDU mods, however, we cannot test every single one. It is only compatible with BGII: ToB. If you do encounter an error, please contact <a href="kae@spellholdstudios.net">K'aeloree</a> or alternatively post on the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/555-viconia-friendship/">forums</a>..

>Although it is not required for the Viconia Friendship to function properly, it is always a good idea to install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a>.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-viconia.exe`**, un-install the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: viconia folder.</em>

<em>When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

**Disable any antivirus** or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: viconia folder and a setup-viconia.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-viconia.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-viconia.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the component settings.

#### Mac OS X

Viconia Friendship for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed zip archive and includes a WeiDU installer. Simply unpack the mod package into your Baldur's Gate II directory and run **`setup-viconia.command`**.

To un-install, run **`setup-viconia.command`** again and select the un-install option.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-viconia --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="faq" id="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is the Viconia Friendship compatible with XYZ mod?**  
A: It most certainly should be, but we have not tested it with every single mod available. If you do encounter an error, please contact <a href="kae@spellholdstudios.net">K'aeloree</a> or alternatively post on the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/555-viconia-friendship/">forums</a>.

**Q: I have a female PC. When will the friendship start?**  
A: It should begin around 15 minutes after Viconia joins your party.

**Q: I have a male PC. When will the friendship start?**  
A: It should begin around 2 hours after you have ended the romance.

**Q: She doesn't seem terribly friendly to *me*!**  
A: What, did you expect hugs and puppies? Viconia is not Aerie.

**Q: I've only had two dialogues, and the friendship has stopped!**  
A: This would be because Viconia most probably doesn't like you. She can be rather picky sometimes, and she won't like just any PC.

**Q: The friendship seems to have stalled after that, what should I do?**  
A: Either you have been so rude to her that she has made the decision to ignore you, or you are at one of several talks requiring certain conditions to occur. Talk 6/7 occurs in the city, talk 9 occurs at rest and the last friendtalk occurs in Hell.

**Q: This mod isn't in character at *all*.**  
A: We're always looking for ways to improve the characterisation in this mod, so please post any suggestions or criticism to <a href="kae@spellholdstudios.net">me</a> or post on the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/555-viconia-friendship/">forums</a>.

**Q: Have you got any plans to expand the mod by adding more dialogues in future?**  
A: I sure do--if you have any suggestions for dialogue you would like to see in the mod, please post it on the forum--I'd be happy to take a look at it!

**Q: If I want to start a game in ToB, can I still get the ToB part of the friendship?**  
A: Certainly. When she joins the group, select the new dialogue option--"Come now, you know me better than that." This will kick-start the friendship..

**Q: Does this mod change the game in any way besides adding more dialogue to Viconia?**  
A: No, it shouldn't.

**Q: Is there any chance that player initiated dialogue will be added in future?**  
A: There are currently no plans for it, but if players are interested in it I would be happy to consider adding some in future versions.

**Q: I would like to translate the Viconia friendship into another language. Any chance you could TRAify the mod?**  
A: Sure, we'd be happy to. If you are interested in translating, just send us a line and I'll see what I can do for the next version.

**Q: God, you're a prick. Please stop modding.**
A: ... no. :laughing:
