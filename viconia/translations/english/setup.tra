Their objective was to eradicate Viconia from the face of the realms. Despite all that <CHARNAME> and his followers could do, Viconia disappeared only ten years after <CHARNAME>'s ascension. Hushed whispers told that the powerful woman had determined to face the two Goddesses herself, but she who was once "The Beautiful Deathbringer" was never heard from again.~

@3    = ~With the events of Amelyssan's death behind her, Viconia stayed with <CHARNAME> for a time, before deciding to embark upon her own path. Taking her share of the spoils of their adventures, she left and travelled to Waterdeep, where she based herself and her operations for years to come. Though nobody is entirely sure to what extent her influence extended, or how exactly her group operated, what is known is that almost all of her followers were adherents of Shar, and that they had a finger in most political and religious dealings in the Sword Coast. Some say Viconia's ultimate plan was to storm the Underdark, others that she simply desired power. What ultimately happened to her or her group is uncertain, and exactly how much they influenced the Realms is shrouded in mystery--much like the dusky drow herself.~
